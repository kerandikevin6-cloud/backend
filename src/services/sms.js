/* ============================================================
   Sending a text

   One door, two gateways behind it. Everything that wants to send a
   message calls this file and never names a provider, so adding a third
   one later is a line in the list below rather than an edit anywhere
   else.

   The order in that list is the preference, and it is deliberate:

     1. Celcom      — the registered sender ID, the one a demo should go
                      out under
     2. Africa's Talking — a sandbox account can be had in a minute,
                      which makes it what a rail is tested on before the
                      real credentials exist

   So Celcom wins when both are set, Africa's Talking is used when only
   it is, and with neither the rail runs silently. Nothing here ever
   falls back mid-send: a provider that answered and refused has given an
   answer, and quietly re-sending the same message through the other one
   is how a customer gets the same receipt twice.

   Two rules, both learned the hard way on rails like this one:

     * sending must never be the reason a request fails. Every call here
       resolves — a refused SMS is logged, not thrown, because a deposit
       that settled is still a deposit that settled.
     * not configured is a state, not an error. With no credentials this
       reports 'off' and the demo runs in silence, which is what a laptop
       with no .env should do.
