   Configuration

   Only two kinds of value live in the environment:

     * secrets — keys that must never be committed
     * per-deployment addresses — the URLs, which differ between
       local and Render

   Everything else is a constant and lives here, in code. A limit like
   the minimum deposit is a product decision, not a deployment one:
   putting it in the environment means the rule can silently differ
   between two running copies of the same service, and nobody notices
   until a customer is refused on one and not the other.
