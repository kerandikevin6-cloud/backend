   A process that dies without saying why is the hardest thing to debug

   An unhandled rejection does NOT take the service down here. The
   default is to exit, and for most programs that is right — but this one
   settles payments, and dying mid-settlement is worse than continuing
   with one broken promise. It is recorded loudly instead.

   An uncaught exception is different: the process is in an unknown state
   after one, so it is logged and then allowed to die so the host can
