-- A second site on the same API
-- Run after 019.
--
-- zenobinary.com is a second front end on this backend. Accounts and
-- money are shared; what the console needs is to tell the two sites
-- apart. Each deposit now records the site it was made through, and
-- the Domains figures count a deposit against that site.
--
-- Rows from before this (and every account that never recorded a site)
-- belong to novibinary.com, which was the only site there was.
